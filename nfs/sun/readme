# Description
Disk scanning tool that works with the Certify application to detect
and track disk drives on SUN storage appliances. The sscs command is
used to detect and report on the disk drives managed by the appliance.
An inventory of installed disk drives is reported to /var/log/messages.

# Dependencies

Passwordless root access to the SUN appliance.

/usr/local/sbin/sscs_report.sh script on the SUN appliance

Access to the the certify "disks" database.

# Install
A sample sscs_report.sh script is included with the documentation.
Copy it to /user/local/sbin on the SUN appliance.

Configure passwordless root access to the SUN appliance. Note, if
the appliance isn't on a private network, you might want to consider
using a special RSA key just for performing disk scans.

Persistent information is maintained in a database. The database must
exist and be accessable from the system collecting the information.
If the database does not exist, intall and configure certify-db.

To enable scanning, edit /etc/cron.daily/sun_diskscan.cron
