# Description
Disk scanning tool that works with the Certify application to detect
and track disk drives on DDN storage devices. An inventory of
installed disk drives is sent to /var/log/messages and also entered
into a mysql database.

# Dependencies
The depencies vary depending on the low level tool used to communicate
with the DDN device. For Livermore Computing HPC Clusters the ddndsh
script is used. This script is located in the /admin/scripts directory.
Other tools may be used in the future.

Persistent information is maintained in a database. The database must
exist and be accessable from the system collecting the information.
If the database does not exist, intall and configure certify-db.

# Install
yum install certify-nfs-ddn
