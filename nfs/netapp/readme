# Description
Disk scanning tool that works with the Certify application to detect
and track disk drives on NetApp storage appliances. An inventory of
installed disk drives is reported to /var/log/messages.

# Dependencies

Passwordless root access to the NetApp.

Access to the the certify "disks" database.

# Install
A sample netapp_report.sh script is included with the documentation.
Copy it to /user/local/sbin on the NetApp appliance.

Configure passwordless root access to the NetApp appliance. Note, if
the appliance isn't on a private network, you might want to consider
using a special RSA key just for performing disk scans.

Persistent information is maintained in a database. The database must
exist and be accessable from the system collecting the information.
If the database does not exist, intall and configure certify-db.

To enable scanning, edit /etc/cron.daily/netapp_diskscan.cron
